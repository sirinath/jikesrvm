# Don't run unit tests until the other tests run correctly

# Most x64 development is still restricted to the baseline compiler.
# TODO: add more configurations (BaseBaseExtremeAssertionsUsePrimitiveWriteBarriers,
# BaseBasePoisoned, BaseBaseConsMS, ...) as soon as prototype is stable enough.

# We ought to extend this later (e.g. with jsr166, gctest, scalabench, SPEC*, ...)

### TEST EXCLUSIONS ###

# sub-tests that are excluded because they don't have 100% pass rates
# TODO: Chart needs to be enabled for x64 as soon as
# the implementation is far enough along.
test.config.dacapo.chart.exclude=true

# sub-tests that are excluded because they cannot pass yet

# These tests test atomicity of accesses for volatile longs and doubles.
# Changes to make them pass for the baseline compilers are work in progress
# (see http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/RVM-1019). No effort has been
# started for the opt compilers yet.
